**Project Title:** College Student Placement Prediction
**Completion Date:** July 2025

**Overview**
This project analyzes student profile data to predict whether a student will be placed in a job after graduation. Using classification models, the analysis identifies which academic, demographic, and behavioral features most influence placement outcomes.

**Objectives**
- Predict placement status based on student attributes
- Identify key factors that influence employability
- Evaluate model performance and compare classification methods
- Explore the ethical implications of modeling sensitive features

**Methods**
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Feature distributions and class imbalance review
- Modeling Techniques: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine
- Preprocessing: One-hot encoding, SMOTE for class balancing
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

**Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

**Key Findings**
- CGPA, employability test score, and specialization were top predictors of placement.
- The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy and handled non-linear patterns well.
- Demographic features such as gender and work experience showed moderate influence but were analyzed with fairness in mind.

**Ethical Considerations**
- Care was taken when including potentially sensitive variables such as gender and education type.

The project stresses that model predictions should be used to support, not stereotype or disadvantage, any group of students.

Transparency and fairness were key considerations in model interpretation.
